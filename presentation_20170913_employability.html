					<h3>Individualising Assessment</h3>
					<h4>Handbook excerpt</h4>
					<blockquote style="font-size:medium" align="left">Your policy project write-up should include the following elements (with the following rough indications of words to be included):<br /><br />
(1)  <strong>Overview</strong>. Provide an introduction to your organisation that may be accessible to a lay-reader and include details of the brief you were given by the organisation. (500 words)<br /><br />
(2)  <strong>Research</strong>: summarise the findings of your individual research work. Explain the mode of research you conducted (interviews, survey, discourse analysis, etc.), explain what you hoped to achieve with this work, and present the results you found. On particular, you should indicate how this research helped illuminate the brief presented by your policy project. (750 words)<br /><br />
(3)  <strong>Analysis</strong>: provide a briefing on the wider problem that serves as a backdrop for your project (i.e. hate-crime; environmental protection; integration of spirituality in business practice; etc.). Provide specific details relating to the West-Midlands context. (750 words)<br /><br />
(4)  <strong>Policy project</strong>: present your group policy project from your own perspective. Explain how this project was designed to address the problem and context you have illuminated above and how it was tailored to the specific needs of your organisation. What did you attempt, how did this relate to the brief you were given by the organisation, and what did you achieve? Include details of your own role within the team and indicate what skills you developed over the course of that work. (500 words)<br /><br />
(5) <strong>Knowledge gained</strong>: Writing towards a public audience, familiar with your organisation, summarise what you learned about religion in the public sphere in conducting your project in this very specific context. What kind of advice might your project and the research you conducted lead you to provide to someone working professionally in business, third sector, or government with relation to the brief you considered?
